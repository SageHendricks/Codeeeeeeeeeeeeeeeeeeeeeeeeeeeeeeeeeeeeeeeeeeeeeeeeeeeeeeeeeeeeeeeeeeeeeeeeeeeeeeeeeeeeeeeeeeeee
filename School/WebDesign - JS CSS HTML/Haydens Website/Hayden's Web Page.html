<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>My name is Hayden Hendricks im an 11th grade student</p>

<h2>Intrest in sohftware Development</h2>
<p>Names Hayden, im 16 and Non binary, i enjoy plsyin DnD, Drawing, Gardening, and playin old games. I had first became intrested in Codinf and programming back in the 5th or 6th grade, and as a young mind does attempted to learn it on their own. I had attepted to learn Java script before giving up due to motivation disapearing, then did the same with python, html, and CSS. I dont know how i had origonaly found out what coding was tho ive been interested in it for quite awhile now.</p></br>

<h2>Plan to Acomplish</h2>
<p>I joined this class in hopes to learn more about coding, and stuff like that, its uses, different langages, how to learn langguage. I had verry litttle informational knowledge on the subjet and wanted to learn abit more about it, and use schooling as a reason to ush through the boring parts and lack of motivation. With it being a personal intrest for so long i though id finaly comfit to learning more about it, abd biw im here. </p></br>

<h2>Career</h2>
<p>As for carreer or plan for the uture ii dont got any set up or anyhting like that was just giong to figure it out as it comes and go with skills and things ive alredy learned and see what i could do with that. Being the pay and demand for most software developement feilds and that ima be spendinf 2 years takin these classes already ill probably end up going into a feild like that. If i could get a job in coding or programming of anything in coputer science thatd be fine with me, the majority of those jobs are in high demand and on he rise. plus they tend to pay a pretty penny each.</p></br>

<h2>Languges</h2>
<p>There are thousands of coding Languages out there, and they all have more or less the same function. They are made to solve problems, piclking the best one to learn can be kinda difficult with that they all have their strengths and weaknesses. One thats good at solving one task may be less thatn ideal in solving a diffrent task so the 'best' one isnt a matter of which one works the bst. The only real way to determine the best language to learn is which ever one you need for the job, or the most poppular ones like Java and C#.The best language realy depends on the situation and wwhat you need it for. the "best" language doesnt exsist, which ever one will get you paid is the one you wanna know.</p></br>
